This app was made through the completion of the course taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps).
 
## About the project
This app was an exercise in using native device features such as the camera on mobile applications exposed through the Flutter SDK. It also provided some practice with SQL and using the Google Maps API.

## Technologies Used
- Dart language
- Flutter SDK (Android & iOS)
- SQLite for storage of locations

## Learning Objectives Achieved
- Using native device features (Camera)
- Using the Google Maps API

## What would I change in the future?
- Compile the app onto a real device to test out the camera feature
- Use ENV files for sensitive API keys instead of hardcoding them (a big no-no that was not taught in the course) - The keys in this repo have been deactivated FYI ;)
